# Lineage

Lineage is a prototype web app built on top of GitHub's platform to easily identify a project's technical dependencies. It's open source, free, and currently in its infancy. As it gains more end users, the plan is to double down & add in more features to make this a powerful, robust application.

## Prerequisites

- You must have a GitHub account.
- You must be owner or contributor for the repository you're looking to integrate with Lineage. If your repository is owned by an organization, you might have to contact your admin to give Lineage the proper access controls. Otherwise, the repository won't be visible.
- Your repository must have a `lineage.yaml` file at the root.

## Quickstart
At the root of your repository, create a `lineage.yaml` file with the following content.
```
dependencies:
  - name: tailwindcss
    dependency_type: 'CSS framework'
    github_repository_link: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss
```
Login to https://thelineage.dev & click on the repository you've added your configuration to. You should see a dependency node in the app now. The root node is named after your repository.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
